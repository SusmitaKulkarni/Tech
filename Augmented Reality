Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, 
real-world environment whose elements are augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as sound,
video, graphics or GPS data.

Video games have been entertaining us for nearly 30 years,
ever since Pong was introduced to arcades in the early 1970’s.
Computer graphics have become much more sophisticated since then, 
and game graphics are pushing the barriers of photorealism.
Now, researchers and engineers are pulling graphics out of your television screen or computer display 
and integrating them into real-world environments. This new technology, called augmented reality,
blurs the line between what’s real and what’s computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell.

On the spectrum between virtual reality, which creates immersive, computer-generated environments,
and the real world, augmented reality is closer to the real world. 
Augmented reality adds graphics, sounds, haptic feedback and smell to the natural world as it exists.
Both video games and cell phones are driving the development of augmented reality. 
Everyone from tourists, to soldiers, to someone looking for the closest subway stop can now benefit 
from the ability to place computer-generated graphics in their field of vision.
